# Machina SDK Samples
To run the tutorials in this repository, you need to have a Machina instance. Obtaining a Machina instance is done by clicking on *"Start For Free"* on the [Machina Developers Portal](https://ionic.com/developers). After your instance has been created, you'll be directed to create your device credentials. Depending on the language chosen, you might have to install an SDK.  Once you have run *"Hello, World!"*, you're ready for the samples.

This repository is used in conjunction with [Machina SDK](https://dev.ionic.com/sdk/features) where there are explanations for each SDK sample. 
Samples are in C++, C#, Java, Javascript, and Python.  **Note:** Not all samples are available in all languages.

The code samples contain tasks for:

* agent creation
* key creation, fetching, and updating with different attributes
* encryption/decryption with different algorithms
* logging
